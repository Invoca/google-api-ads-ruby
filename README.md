## Invoca disclaimer

Some technical details about the adwords gem that is important to know expecially if we upgrade versions:

### Reason we forked the gem

* Tech-480 - Exception messages were not being passed in appropriately, this was making it difficult to troubleshoot in script/console.
* Made some changes around the exceptions:
 * ApiException class now calls super(message)  <https://github.com/Invoca/google-api-ads-ruby/commit/183d5fb14636ca4713ffa426f2a31a5cd267fa9c>
  * Had to update `adwords_api/errors.rb to call super(exception_data[:message])` in the initializer
  * Edit `adwords_api/lib/adwords_api/v201409/customer_service_registry.rb` to no longer have attr_reader message <https://github.com/Invoca/google-api-ads-ruby/commit/89053f5b9e6e7e064586b741c22301eb0cdaf949>
     * This is the imporant change becuase there are many other registry files and other api versions that do not have this change, so if we observe exception messages not showing as expected, you will likely have to apply similar changes to the exception that is being thrown.
     * Also, when a new AdWords version comes out, these changes will not carry over. We will want to re-apply them to the new version.
          
### How to run the test for the gem
* Go into which folder you want to test
* Be sure to set ruby 2.1.2, `rbenv local 2.1.2`
* `rake test`
* If you have dependencies with httpi or savon, try uninstalling those gems and trying again.

  


# Ads API Client Libraries for Ruby

This project hosts the new Ads common framework for Ruby, as well as the Ruby
client libraries for the various SOAP-based Ads APIs at Google.

The Ruby client libraries make it easier to write Ruby clients to
programmatically access your accounts.

**New to the library?** Take a look at the [wiki for this project]
(https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/wiki).

[master RSS feed on GitHub]

## Products currently supported

 - Google AdWords API
 - Google's DoubleClick For Publishers API

## Client library features

 - Support for logging incoming and outgoing SOAP messages
 - Support for logging request information
 - Based on Savon library
 - Ruby 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 compatible
 - OAuth2 and OAuth2 JWT built-in authentication
 - Local validation for parameter number and type on API calls
 - Thread-safe
 - Ruby-like syntax, by converting all method names and properties to
   snake\_case instead of lowerCamelCase
 - Simplified development model by using arrays and hashes instead of solid
   objects
 - (AdWords) Full support for reporting and BatchJobService uploads

## Getting started

1. Install your library of choice using RubyGems.

        $ gem install google-adwords-api

   or

        $ gem install google-dfp-api

   Note: If you're using a version of Ruby lower than 2.2.2, you will need to
   manually install a previous version of Rack, a dependency of our HTTP
   library. You can do this with:

        $ gem install rack -v 1.6.4

1. Copy the sample config file (**adwords_api.yml** or **dfp_api.yml**) for your
product to your home directory and fill out the required properties.

  * [adwords_api.yml](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/blob/master/adwords_api/adwords_api.yml)
  * [dfp_api.yml](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/blob/master/dfp_api/dfp_api.yml)

1. Setup your OAuth2 credentials.

  The AdWords and DoubleClick for Publishers APIs use
[OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) as the authentication mechanism. Follow the
appropriate guide below based on your use case.

  **If you're accessing an API using your own credentials...**

  * [Using AdWords](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/wiki/API-access-using-own-credentials-(installed-application-flow))
  * [Using DFP](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/wiki/API-access-using-own-credentials-(server-to-server-flow))

  **If you're accessing an API on behalf of clients...**

  * [Developing a web application (AdWords or DFP)](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/wiki/API-access-on-behalf-of-your-clients-(web-flow))

1. See each product's individual README for more specific instructions:

  * [AdWords](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/blob/master/adwords_api/README.md)
  * [DFP](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/blob/master/dfp_api/README.md)
